Examples
-------------------

1. Simplest

1.1 Create a Grid:

    class SimpleGrid(DataGrid):
        name = NonDatabaseColumn("Hello")

1.2 In the views
    
    def simple(request):
        books = Book.objects.all()
        return SimpleGrid(request, books).render_to_response("mylibrary/simple.html")
    
This creates a view with as many rows as the elemns in `books` queryset.

2. A little better.

OK that grid is useless, lets createa one with real data.

    class RealGrid(DataGrid):
        name = Column()
        publisher = Column()
        recommended_by = Column()

This will show the attributes named `name`, `publisher` and `recommended_by`.
view remains about same.


    def real(request):
        books = Book.objects.all()
        return RealGrid(request, books).render_to_response("mylibrary/real.html")
