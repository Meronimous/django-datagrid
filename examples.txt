1. Simplest

1.1 Create a Grid:

    class SimpleGrid(DataGrid):
        name = NonDatabaseColumn("Hello")

1.2 In the views
    
    def simple(request):
        books = Book.objects.all()
        return SimpleGrid(request, books).render_to_response("mylibrary/simple.html")
    
This creates a view with as many rows as the elemns in `books` queryset.
